/* INFO
# Semaphore system

 The consensus routine is the main function that runs the consensus algorithm.
 Within the consensus routine there is a secretary system that ensure the shard
 to have a common state and to avoid race conditions such as node desynchronization.

 The secretary node is chosen as the first node in the shard, and it cordinates the
 progression of the consensus routine.
 
 For each important step of the consensus routine, the local node will broadcast a
 message to the secretary to inform them that the step has been completed. When all
 nodes have completed the step, the secretary will send a message to the shard
 to inform them that the step has been completed and they can continue with the next step.
 
 This way we ensure that the shard will have a common state and will be able to
 continue the consensus routine.

 For example, the SecretaryManager is initialized at the beginning of the consensus routine
 and the local status is updated to reflect that we are in consensus loop. Then the node 
 will send a message to the secretary to inform them that we are in consensus loop.
 Prior to continue the consensus routine, the local node will wait that also the
 other nodes in the shard are in consensus loop by waiting for the secretary to send
 a message (greenlight) to continue the consensus routine.
